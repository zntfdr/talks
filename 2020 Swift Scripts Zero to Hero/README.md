# Abstract

Every iOS/macOS developer uses (scripting) tools such as fastlane and SwiftLint to automate tasks as much as possible: in this talk we will dive into how we can build our own Swift scripts.

This is a technical talk, and presents code to the audience:
many slides will contain code that can be copy-pasted to existing projects, or that can be used as a start for new (scripting) tools.

30 minutes talk.
