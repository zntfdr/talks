# Abstract
Every iOS/macOS developer uses (scripting) tools such as fastlane and swiftLint to automate tasks as much work as possible: 
in this talk we will dive into how we can build our own Swift scripts.

The talk has four sections: 

1. A brief introduction to the Swift Package Manager, package executables, and how they differ from package libraries.
2. Examples on how to solve things that are trivial on apps but more tricky on scripts.
3. More advanced examples on scripts features.
4. A brief look to whatâ€™s next for scripting in Swift.

This is a technical talk, and presents code to the audience:
many slides will contain code that can be copy-pasted to existing projects, or that can be used as a start for new (scripting) tools.

30 minutes talk.
